Infamia di Creti is a game based on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. Players play as Theseus, a young prince, who sets out on a quest to slay the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monster at the center of the maze, to save the people of Crete from being sacrificed to it. Theseus must travel through three rooms of the maze in order to reach the center where the Minotaur lives. The game's learning objective is to teach players about Java classes and methods. Players can upgrade and change the type of Theseus's weapon by writing code using provided classes and methods. 

# Basic Instructions

Once the game loads in the browser, you must click on "Enter the Maze" to begin the game. The game begins with a tutorial, during which Ariadne, the princess of Crete, provides Theseus with a bow and guides him through an example of how to use the weapons system. In the tutorial, Thesues must increase the damage of his bow and once he is successful he can enter the maze. Theseus enters a room with two skeleton enemies which he must defeat to progress to the next room. There are two rooms after the initial room that Theseus must progress through to reach the Minotaur at the center of the maze. These two rooms have different enemies and the difficulty level of the game increases as Theseus progresses through the room. The number of enemies increases as well as how much health they have. Upon death, enemies will drop a weapon, a weapon upgrade feature, or a weapon type feature. The increasing difficulty encourages the player to use the weapon system to modify their weapon. Once Theseus reaches the center of the maze, he must defeat the Minotaur to win the game and save the people of Crete.
